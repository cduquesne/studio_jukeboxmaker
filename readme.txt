1. Prepare your data : the jukebox will be created from a folder hierarchy containing audio (wav, mp3, ogg).
Images will be created from the folder and file names, so shorten them for readability if needed.

2. Change paths in "settings.txt"
inputPath should point to your target audio folder (it can contain sub folders)
outputPath is where the STUdio-compatible zip file is created

3. Run exe

4. Use STUdio to convert the created pack and put it on your device
